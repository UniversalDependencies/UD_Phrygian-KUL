# Summary

UD Phrygian-KUL annotates the New Phrygian subcorpus of the ancient Phrygian language as part of a Master's thesis in linguistics at KU Leuven.


# Introduction

UD Phrygian-KUL annotates the New Phrygian subcorpus of the ancient Phrygian language. The data are comprised of epigraphic material dating ca. 1st-3rd centuries CE following the edition by Bartomeu Obrador-Cursach (2020, pp. 525-606), with additional grammatical information taken from Ligorio and Lubotsky (2018) and a notable emendation by Hämmig (2022).

In case any rights were violated, please notify the contributors so that we can resolve the issue.

Since the data are epigraphic, the sentences can be linked to various metadata through stable identifiers provided by Trismegistos (https://www.trismegistos.org/tm/index.php; cf. Depauw & Gheldof, 2014). This way, there is little difficulty in finding the provenance and approximate date of every New Phrygian inscription.


# Acknowledgments

The data were annotated by Oggi Peeters as part of a Master's thesis in linguistics at KU Leuven (Peeters, 2024). Thus, it goes without saying that any errors are my own. A big thank-you goes to supervisors Alek Keersmaekers and Toon Van Hal for their guidance throughout the project, as well as to Mark Depauw for his help in acquiring the necessary textual metadata from Trismegistos.
